# wallpapers

This repository is dedicated to housing my personal desktop wallpapers.

For every wallpaper change, a new release will be issued, with the wallpaper
sources provided on the release information page.

The motivation behind creating this repository stems from my preference not to
include large files like wallpapers in my computer configuration repository. 
Yes, I maintain a repository specifically for configuring my computer, as I'm 
utilizing NixOS, and Nix is exceptionally powerful.

The purpose of these releases is to streamline the process of creating a local 
derivation that can effortlessly fetch and implement a specified wallpaper. 
With just a few lines of derivation code in the configuration file, I can 
integrate the wallpaper without cluttering the configuration repository. 
This approach proves to be highly efficient and convenient.
